## Project Description

I will be building an app focusing on teaching children to develop better emotional/mental health skills through guided journaling. This app is also geared towards children and adults with special needs, to help better maintain routine and recenter.

## MVP

### Back-End

- Functioning routes that store user information
- functioning routes that store users entries
- JWT authorization 

### Front-End

- Pulls in from user api
- is able to register new user and login returning users
- Takes journal entries and posts to api
- Breathing animation
- Responsive, mobile-first design

## PostMVP 

- Pure 'breathing' and journaling sections and navigation
- More detailed breathing animation. 
- More extensive user dashboad
- Better navigational layouts
- Add to the midnful journaling process, such as a grounding page where your forced to lok around you for a certain color, count how many times they see that color, and input that number. 
- Add radical acceptance concepts into it. Maybe pages where you can practice radical acceptance
- Add goals or routine section
